## Challenge Summary
The script devolped for the provided summary was able to accomplish all the needs in your ask, furthermore this same script with some modifications could be used for any election. If provided with more data we could use this script to look deeper into voter demogrpahics by counties or even cities if given the data. If the election commission wanted to have a better idea of what age their voters are in respective counties we could use this script; with that information the commission could work to target the age group that had the lowest turn out in hopes of motivating more people to participate in the great experiment of democracy!
